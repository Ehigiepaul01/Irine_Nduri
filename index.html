                  daughter. As she joined the playgroup, she was shy and timid.
                  She hardly speak freely to anyone let alone her peers. In your
                  hands, she found not only a teacher but a motther for she
                  gradually began loving school and enjoyed the learning
                  experience.<br />
                  Your qualities of a parent, committed, passionate, caring and
                  loving teacher made my daughter always look forward to another
                  day in school. Your interaction with her built confidence in
                  her and this formed a stable foundation in her learning going
                  forward. Your dedication is highly commendable, i really
                  appreciate as you're a great teacher. Best wished as you
                  continue touching the lives of other little angels. &rdquo;

                  girl in play group, from the shy and introvert girl she was to
                  now the grown up and confident girl she is. Thank you for the
                  confidence you instilled in her and she can now stand up for
                  herself. You played both the teacher and mother role
                  perfectly, as delicate as she was with frequent infections you
                  were always ready to step in as a mmother and a nurse beside
                  your teaching role. <br />
                  This made Sada love school which she does up till now, be
                  blessed abundantly. The foundation you built in her is what
                  has brought her this far and will always be her pillar in both
                  academic and social life. Be blessed as you continue touching
                  many more souls and may you find favour between God and men.
